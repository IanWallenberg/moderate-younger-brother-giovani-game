# WHAT üéÆ <br>
My fourth project is a group project where we were introduced to the JavaScript framework Phaser.js. and thus using it in order to create a video game for a gaming exhibition as part of presentation. This project was made during 17/11 to 3/12 <br>
We had two and a half week to come up with an idea for a game, design, develop and test it out. <br>
We worked mainly in group throughout the process, as it was heavy on JavaScript and it was a new field to work with Phaser and understand the logic of the framework in comparision to regular JavaScript. And we came up with the idea of creating an unknown brother to Super Mario, the Moderate Giovanni who is just... okay. He is doing the best he can. Not everyone is super. <br>
# LEARNINGS üçÑ <br>
And not everyone is super, but with effort I went from knowing not much to being pretty super with Phaser.js. I learned a lot about the structure of the framework and how to load in components, creating and setting physics to each element with functionality. I also to become more comfortable with JavaScript and focusing on logics of coding, whether it's game focused or front end focused. This module was very heavy on the logical part of coding, which I do need to work on throughout my studies, so I learned to push myself more with this part of coding. <br>

# THOUGHTS ‚ùì <br>
This was a challenge of a project. I have dabbled a bit in Unity to create simple 2D games before, so it felt a bit similar to it in the way you have to structure the project, but working with Phaser was very new as it was not quite the JavaScript I know and not quite the C# I know. But it was a good challenge and I'm proud of the outcome. And it was fun as I am a gamer and enjoyed creating something new but also with a nostalgic vibe, and ode to Super Mario on SNES. <br>
It was continious work with git, gitHub and working in branches, which was very much needed, to not shy away from it. <br>
# INSTRUCTIONS üçÑ <br>
